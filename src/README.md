# CIS 700 Spring 2016 - Special Topics in Procedural Graphics

## Course Description
Sprawling cities, dense vegetation, infinite worlds &mdash; procedural graphics empower technical artists to quickly create complex digital assets that would otherwise be unfeasible. This course is intended to introduce the mathematical and algorithmic foundations of procedural modeling and animation techniques, and to offer hands-on experience designing and implementing “visual recipes” in original graphics projects by applying these methods. Students should have a strong interest in both the creative and technical aspects of computer graphics, as well as a solid programming background.

## Prerequisites
CIS 460/560

## Course Goals
The student will develop and implement a suite of procedural content generation techniques, and experiment with a wide set of existing methods.

## Textbooks(s) and/or other Required Materials
 A Sampler of Useful Computational Tools for Applied Geometry, Computer Graphics, and Image Processing", Daniel Cohen-Or, Chen Greif, Tao Ju, Niloy J. Mitra, Ariel Shamir, Olga Sorkine-Hornung, Hao (Richard) Zhang

## Grading Policy
Weekly homework assignments (70%) and the final project (30%) will constitute all of the grading for this class. Grading will be on the basis of the following:
  - **Use of techniques:** Does you assignment apply the techniques discussed in class in an interesting way? Did your approach to the project demonstrate creative thought?
  - **Engineering effort/organization:** Was your code well-structured, demonstrating a good understanding of software engineering principles?
  - **Visuals:** Ultimately, this class is about producing algorithmic visual output, so the look of your procedural artwork is important. We will not grade on the basis of whether we like your style, but we will grade based on how well you were able to achieve your intended effect, and how much effort you put into polishing the output.
