            <p>For this assignment you&#39;ll be building directly off of Project 3. To make things easier to keep track of, please fork and clone this repository
              <a href="https://github.com/CIS700-Procedural-Graphics/Project4-Shape-Grammar">https://github.com/CIS700-Procedural-Graphics/Project4-Shape-Grammar</a>  and copy your Project 3 code to start.</p>
            <p><strong>Goal:</strong>  to model an urban environment using a shape grammar. </p>
            <p><strong>Note:</strong>  We’re well aware that a nice-looking procedural city is a lot of work for a single week. Focus on designing a nice building grammar. The city layout strategies outlined in class (the extended l-systems) are complex and
              not expected. We will be satisfied with something reasonably simple, just not a uniform grid!</p>
            <h2 id="symbol-node-5-points-">Symbol Node (5 points)</h2>
            <p>Modify your symbol node class to include attributes necessary for rendering, such as</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Associated geometry instance</li>
              <li>Position</li>
              <li>Scale </li>
              <li>Anything else you may need</li>
            </ul>
            <h2 id="grammar-design-55-points-">Grammar design (55 points)</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>Design at least five shape grammar rules for producing procedural buildings. Your buildings should vary in geometry and decorative features (beyond just differently-scaled cubes!). At least some of your rules should create child geometry
                that is in some way dependent on its parent’s state. (20 points)
                <ul>
                  <li>Eg. A building may be subdivided along the x, y, or z axis into two smaller buildings</li>
                  <li>Some of your rules must be designed to use some property about its location. (10 points)</li>
                  <li>Your grammar should have some element of variation so your buildings are non-deterministic. Eg. your buildings sometimes subdivide along the x axis, and sometimes the y. (10 points) </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Write a renderer that will interpret the results of your shape grammar parser and adds the appropriate geometry to your scene for each symbol in your set. (10 points)</li>
            </ul>
            <h2 id="create-a-city-30-points-">Create a city (30 points)</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>Add a ground plane or some other base terrain to your scene (0 points, come on now)</li>
              <li>Using any strategy you’d like, procedurally generate features that demarcate your city into different areas in an interesting and plausible way (Just a uniform grid is neither interesting nor plausible). (20 points)
                <ul>
                  <li>Suggestions: roads, rivers, lakes, parks, high-population density</li>
                  <li>Note, these features don’t have to be directly visible, like high-population density, but they should somehow be visible in the appearance or arrangement of your buildings. Eg. High population density is more likely to generate taller
                    buildings</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Generate buildings throughout your city, using information about your city’s features. Color your buildings with a method that uses some aspect of its state. Eg. Color buildings by height, by population density, by number of rules used to
                generate it. (5 points)</li>
              <li>Document your grammar rules and general approach in the readme. (5 points)</li>
              <li>???</li>
              <li>Profit.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2 id="make-it-interesting-10-">Make it interesting (10)</h2>
            <p>Experiment! Make your city a work of art.</p>
            <h2 id="warnings-">Warnings:</h2>
            <p>You can very easily blow up three.js with this assignment. With a very simple grammar, our medium quality machine was able to handle 100 buildings with 6 generations each, but be careful if you’re doing this all CPU-side.</p>
            <h2 id="suggestions-for-the-overachievers-">Suggestions for the overachievers:</h2>
            <p>Go for a very high level of decorative detail! Place buildings with a strategy such that buildings have doors and windows that are always accessible. Generate buildings with coherent interiors If dividing your city into lots, generate odd-shaped
              lots and create building meshes that match their shape ie. rather than working with cubes, extrude upwards from the building footprints you find to generate a starting mesh to subdivide rather than starting with platonic geometry.</p>
